# LearningCOBOL
A repository of programs written to self-learn COBOL

Most of the stuff in here is very basic, and mostly serve as programming exercises to get familiar with the language.
Right now, the most complex program is BANK, which acts as the backend of a banking system.

If someone happens to come across this repository and has suggestions for improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.
